              A hackathon is an event where programmers, designers, and others
              collaborate intensively to develop software or hardware projects
              within a limited time frame, typically 24-48 hours.
              <br>
              <strong>Hack Synthesis</strong> is a hackathon that brings
              together diverse minds to merge <b>ideas</b>, <b>skills</b>, and
              <b>technologies</b> into groundbreaking solutions. In this dynamic
              event, participants will synthesize creativity and logic, blending
              innovation with collaboration to tackle complex challenges. Hack
              Synthesis is more than just coding—it's about creating a
              harmonious fusion of different perspectives to build something
              extraordinary. Whether you're a developer, designer, or
              strategist, this is your chance to contribute to a collective
              masterpiece that pushes the boundaries of technology and

            <h3>1. Disaster Management System</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Story:</strong> In 2023, a coastal town was hit by a
              massive cyclone that disrupted communication, electricity, and
              emergency services. Many lives were lost because people couldn’t
              get real-time information or request help efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Design a disaster management
              system that can operate in low-connectivity areas, providing
              real-time updates, emergency alerts, and a platform for people to
              request assistance. The system should also allow for coordination
              among emergency services, volunteers, and the local government.

            <h3>2. Personalized Healthcare Assistant</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Story:</strong> An elderly man living alone was diagnosed
              with multiple chronic conditions, including diabetes and
              hypertension. Managing his medications, diet, and doctor's
              appointments became overwhelming, leading to frequent hospital
              visits.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Develop a personalized
              healthcare assistant application that helps patients manage their
              chronic conditions. The app should include features like
              medication reminders, diet suggestions based on health conditions,
              and appointment scheduling. Additionally, it should integrate with
              wearable devices to monitor vital signs in real-time and alert
              caregivers or doctors if something is wrong.

            <h3>3. Smart Education Platform</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Story:</strong> During the COVID-19 pandemic, a rural
              school struggled to continue education online due to a lack of
              resources and internet connectivity. Many students fell behind
              because they couldn’t access the materials or interact with their
              teachers.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Create a smart education
              platform that is accessible in low-bandwidth environments and
              provides interactive, personalized learning experiences. The
              platform should include offline content access, real-time
              teacher-student interaction, and tools for tracking student
              progress. It should also support multiple languages and be
              adaptable for different age groups.

            <h3>4. Sustainable Urban Mobility</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Story:</strong> A city known for its high traffic
              congestion is facing increasing pollution levels and a decline in
              the quality of life for its residents. Commuters spend hours in
              traffic daily, leading to frustration and economic loss.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Design a sustainable urban
              mobility solution that reduces traffic congestion and pollution in
              a metropolitan city. The solution could include a combination of
              public transportation enhancements, ride-sharing, electric vehicle
              incentives, and smart traffic management systems. The goal is to
              make commuting more efficient, affordable, and environmentally
              friendly.

            <h3>5. AI-Powered Mental Health Support</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Story:</strong> A university student struggling with
              anxiety and depression finds it difficult to seek help due to the
              stigma surrounding mental health. As a result, their academic
              performance and personal life suffer.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Develop an AI-powered mental
              health support system that provides students with confidential,
              round-the-clock assistance. The system should include features
              like mood tracking, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) exercises,
              and access to professional counselors through chat or video calls.
              It should also provide users with resources to help them manage
              stress, anxiety, and depression in a safe and supportive
              environment.

              Participants are encouraged to bring forward any innovative idea
              or solution they are passionate about. The goal is to think
              outside the box and address a problem of your choice using
